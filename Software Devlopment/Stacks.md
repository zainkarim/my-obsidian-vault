A stack supports 3 operations:
1. Pushing an element to the end of the stack
2. Popping an element from the end of the stack
3. Peeking at/Topping an element from the end of the stack(reading).

| Operation | Big-O Time |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Push      | $O(1)$     |
| Pop       | $O(1)$     |
| Peek/Top  | $O(1)$     |

It may be helpful to think of a stack as a vertical dynamic array.

Stacks are considered a **<u>LIFO</u>** (last in first out) data structure.
